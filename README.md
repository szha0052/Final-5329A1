# Final-5329A1
**Instructions for Running the Code:**

1. **Download the Dataset**  
   First, access the following link: [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1E8OcgpVay_1RB-XrBSOKkBDs9LacFC-6?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1E8OcgpVay_1RB-XrBSOKkBDs9LacFC-6?usp=sharing). Download the shared file **COMP5329_A1**, decompress it, and store it in the “MyDrive” directory of your personal Google Drive.

2. **Run the Notebooks**  
   Next, open the GitHub repository at [https://github.com/szha0052/Final-5329A1](https://github.com/szha0052/Final-5329A1), where you will find two Jupyter notebooks: **Preliminary_experiment.ipynb** and **Grid_search&Ablation.ipynb**. For each notebook, click **“Open in Colab”** to launch the notebook in Google Colab. Execute the first cell of the notebook to authenticate access to your Google Drive. Once successfully connected, you may proceed to run all code cells in sequence.

   1. **Preliminary_experiment.ipynb**  
      This notebook is primarily used for initial experimental verification, providing baseline results that inform subsequent grid search procedures.

   2. **Grid_search&Ablation.ipynb**  
      This notebook is dedicated to conducting the grid search and ablation studies to refine the model and validate the effects of various components.
